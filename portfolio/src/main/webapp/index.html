                                <p>Another interest of mine is dancing. I can often be found in the dance studio, working 
                                    on new choregraphy or practicing for the upcoming dance performance. I always knew I wanted
                                    to try a new activity in college, so I decided to audition for a dance company despite having had no 
                                    prior dance experience. </p>

                                    me to run for an officer position and I was granted opportunities for growth, 
                                    such as the chance to co-choreograph an audition piece and choreograph workshops. </p>
