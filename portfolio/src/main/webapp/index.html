      <h2>About Me: Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>I'm passionate about volunteering and offering guidance and leadership to younger students.
          Through Student Government I am able to coordinate with other organizations to organize 
          and participate in volunteer events. Also, I was a mentor to many incoming college freshmen as 
          a leader in Princeton University's Freshmen Orienation Program, Community Action, in which we engaged
          in community service while building a sense of community and belonging among the students.

      <p> Another interest of mine is dancing. I can often be found in the dance studio, working 
            on new choregraphy or practicing for the upcoming dance performance. I always knew I wanted
            to try a new activity in college, so I decided to audition for a dance company despite having had no 
            prior dance experience. However, I was accepted into the company and continued to grow as a 
            leader and dancer over the years. For example, when I was a freshman, former officers encouraged
            me to run for an officer position and I was granted opportunities for growth, 
            such as the chance to co-choreograph an audition piece and choreograph workshops.
